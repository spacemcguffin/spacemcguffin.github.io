<p>Formerly online under a variety of usernames<sup><a class="tooltip-top" data-tooltip="[redacted due to cringe]">[1]</a></sup>, I'm now a bit of a social media hermit. The internet I loved has been lost to time. I'm enjoying the peace and quiet, with my own space here. My own space. <i>My space</i>. Nice.</p>

<p>After two decades frequenting the likes of Piczo, Bebo, Blogger, <a href="/myspace" target="_blank"><b>MySpace</b></a>, Dailybooth, Tumblr, <a href="/livejournal" target="_blank"><b>LiveJournal</b></a>, Wordpress, Facebook, Twitter, and other forums, I can't keep up anymore. I'm exhausted. And every few months, Twitter seems to crumble so people head over to Threads, Bluesky, TikTok, and whatever else is out there. I'm old. I'm also just way more private than I used to be. Between 2008 and 2012, I wrote an online diary on LiveJournal. For years later, I posted over 25,000 tweets. Then, one random day in the mid-2010s, I just nuked it all. Gone, at the click of a button. Since then, I've occasionally made tweets but they don't stay online long, and my old habits have died hard. Now, I just have a couple of empty profiles around the internet, purely for browsing and lurking from the shadows, and for private messaging friends.</p>

<p>And I have this website. I've mostly used it for playing around with CSS and HTML, creating templates and just fucking about with code. Most of my stuff has been temporary.<sup><a class="tooltip-top" data-tooltip="(Who knows if this post will even stay online.)">[2]</a></sup> The only fixed feature of <b><i>lewis.lc</i></b> is an archive of my <a href="/diary" target="_blank"><b>diary entries</b></a>. Using the Wayback Machine, I was able to salvage most titles from 2008 and 2009, though the rest are gone. Since 2021, I've resumed writing a diary but it's offline.</p>

<p>Time will tell if I do anything more with this website. I pay for the domain name, so I might as well, but who knows. It's quiet here. It's peaceful. If you see me around the internet, feel free to drop a message and say hello.</p>

<p>Just had a nostalgic flashback to Dailybooth. Such fun times. So many people I used to natter with on there, and I used to post so many random photos, all of which are now lost to the waves of history. Except this one xD </p>

<p>My week has consisted of scaffolding, online dating, spring cleaning and a Cyberman bust. One night last week part of our roof fell off so we’re having renovations done. The house is covered in scaffolding and it’s serving as a nice visual metaphor of my life at the moment. I spent Monday quite excited tbh, having met a really great girl online, but come the middle of the week she seemed to be totally uninterested in me, yay. So I perked myself up, between eating myself into comas and job hunting, by ordering an 80s Cyberman bust from Forbidden Planet. Frankly, it’s way more gorgeous than any girl will ever be so whatevs.</p>

<p>And today I’ve spring cleaned most of the house, top to bottom, because I’m an adult or something. That crept up on me and now it’s just constantly happening. And I’m blogging again. Legit blogging here on Tumblr, reclaiming it back one letter at a time from those who just reblog endless photos of food and cats dressed up as Olaf from <i>Frozen</i>.</p>

<p>I’ve kind of become disillusioned with Twitter lately, so I’m going to hide out here for a while. As long as I avoid the majority of the rest of Tumblr, I’ll be fine. I like it here.</p>

  <h3>Reflecting on 2012</h3>

<p>For the last few years, I’ve kept an online diary over on LiveJournal and it’s become tradition for me to bullet point various events and achievements on New Year’s Eve.</p>

<p>I find the notion of ‘the best year’ in your life quite silly (every year is extremely different, and every experience enhances your life or affects you somehow) but, in terms of my creative writing portfolio, 2012 has been my most successful year.</p>

<p>I finished my first year of university and levelled up to the second, and I’ve been published twice - once on <i>The Pygmy Giant</i> and once in an actual book! In addition, I also started up my <i>Celebrate Regenerate</i> project which has taken off better than I ever could’ve expected.</p>

<p>Not only that, but I’ve emailed various <i>Doctor Who</i> writers, directors and producers who have said they’d be happy to do interviews for the book. That’ll be happening, hopefully, in January 2013 and if that wasn’t enough I’ve also been given the opportunity to work with <i>Doctor Who Adventures</i> magazine in February 2013 too! Both of these, though happening next year, were planned and arranged this year and therefore contribute to my 2012 portfolio.</p>

<p>In contacting agents, being published, advertising and editing submissions for my own anthology book, my confidence this year has been boosted massively and I hope 2013 is just as creative and fun too! :) </p>

  <h3>Stupid Exam Questions</h3>


		
<section id="page">

<div class="article">

<p>Casually looking back through my diary and I came across something rather genius – my final ever GCSE exam question.</p>

<p>It was on a science paper and I’d happily written ‘not got a clue’ under most of the questions before I turned over to the last page. You know the one – the one before the page which says ‘Blank Page’. (Never quite worked that one out.)</p>

<p>The final question revolved around the concept of friction and momentum. Fair enough, it’s a science paper, and friction is a science-y thing… but then came the scenario / question (complete with a diagram, I should add)...</p>

<p><i>“Frank is doing an experiment. He is in an ice rink with a box, and his friend sits in the box. Frank then drags the cardboard box around the ice rink. What happens to his friend?”</i></p>

<p>...what.</p>

<p>Living in student flats is often quite shit due to cuntish people making shitloads of noise, and generally being arseholes. The guy in the room above me, especially.</p>

<p>But tonight, as I’m feeling the lowest I’ve felt for a long time, all I can hear is someone playing the guitar and I love it. It’s keeping me sane. I just want to go and hug whoever it is and say thanks.</p>
