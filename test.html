      <h2>notes</h2>

    <main id="about">

<p>Formerly online under a variety of usernames <i>[redacted due to cringe]</i>, I'm now a bit of a social media hermit. The internet I loved has been lost to time. I'm enjoying the peace and quiet, with my own space here. My own space. My space. Nice.</p>

<p>After two decades frequenting the likes of Piczo, Bebo, Blogger, MySpace, Dailybooth, Tumblr, LiveJournal, Wordpress, Facebook, Twitter, and other forums, I can't keep up anymore. I'm exhausted. And every few months, Twitter seems to crumble so people head over to Threads, Bluesky, TikTok, and whatever else is out there. I'm old. I'm also just way more private than I used to be. Between 2008 and 2012, I wrote an online diary on LiveJournal. For years later, I posted over 25,000 tweets. Then, one random day in the mid-2010s, I just nuked it all. Gone, at the click of a button. Since then, I've occasionally made tweets but they don't stay online long, and my old habits have died hard. Now, I just have a couple of empty profiles around the internet, purely for browsing and lurking from the shadows, and for private messaging friends.</p>

<p>And I have this website. I've mostly used it for playing around with CSS and HTML, creating templates and just fucking about with code. Most of my stuff has been temporary. (Who knows if this post will even stay online.) The only fixed feature of <b>lewis.lc</b> is an archive of my diary entries. Using the Wayback Archive, I was able to salvage most titles from 2008 and 2009, though the rest are gone. Since 2021, I've resumed writing a diary but it's offline.</p>

<p>Time will tell if I do anything more with this website. I pay for the domain name, so I might as well, but who knows. It's quiet here. It's peaceful. If you see me around the internet, feel free to drop a message and say hello.</p>
