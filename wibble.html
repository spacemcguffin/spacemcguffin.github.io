dear diary,<br /><br />to me, the worst feeling in the world is feeling invisible to the people you love. worked too hard on a birthday scavenger hunt clue for my best friend—y'know, the one who completely and totally <i>forgot</i> my birthday this year?—wondering the whole time if they'd finally realize, when they watched it, that mine had passed them by completely. <br /><br />i do this to myself all the time. i dig myself into these holes and then build up all these secret feelings, brick by brick, until i've walled myself in. how to say to someone you've known for 14 years now that you aren't sure if they care about you anymore? how to broach the subject of all the times i've felt belittled or ignored or unnoticed over the last few years? they don't seem to notice, after all. or are they keeping their feelings to themself?<br /><br />i don't trust my own interpretations of reality, so i'm always waiting to see if the other person is going to validate them. do they feel weird? do they feel distant? does it feel strange and taut to them? i talk all the time in book club, so the one time i'm not feeling like it, i wonder if it registers with anyone. it doesn't seem to. if i noticed that someone i cared about wasn't talking a lot, i'd ask if anything was up. the few times i've directly noticed some pretty tense exchanges or undeniable strangeness, i've asked or said something about it, apologized, acknowledged they might be feeling some kind of way. even in those moments, they didn't confirm...but they didn't <i>deny</i> either. sometimes silence is the loudest answer you get.<br /><br />the one thing i don't want to have to do in my life is force people to care about me. i don't think it's that much to ask. i know we're all human, i know i'm not perfect, i know i fuck up and forget things and get selfish and disappear—but i try! i feel like i do a consistent and obvious job of <i>trying</i>. i remember dates, i check in about things, i gas my friends up, i'm always there when someone actually needs me. i don't have that many friends; i try to take care of my friendships with them. sometimes it feels like i'm the only one.<br /><br />&lt;3&gt;space,<br />gentle

dear diary,<br /><br />i started writing this whole fucking thing about being hyperverbal all because i wanted to complain about how often i feel like my friends don't respond to specifically my text messages in a group chat.<br /><br />i am also currently on my blood sorcery apprenticeship, aka my period. yes it's POSSIBLE that these two things are related, and it's also POSSIBLE that, regardless of my hormones, everyone who says they love me secretly hates me because 1) i'm actually the worst and also 2) somehow they're all also the worst. both of these are possibilities okay!!!!!<br /><br />i've gotten so, so much better at realizing when it's hormones, at still identifying the feelings that might be founded somewhere underneath all the hormonal histrionics. tuesday night, m rubbed my legs for me. i'd been rolling my IT bands out myself regularly, and was feeling so proud of the work i'd done on them, but man, getting them worked on fucking hurt. we ended with my right leg, the worse one, and i was a little teary by the end. i got up and went to the bathroom and started to cry. <i>i just really miss running,</i> i thought, <i>and i'm doing all this hard work that's paying off in nothing but shitty runs.</i> and then a calmer voice came to the fore and said <i>yeah, it totally sucks, no denying that, but it's not for nothing, and if you want to keep running it might be what you have to do. and also, girl, i think you might be feeling a little hormonal.</i> what kind of emotional maturity is this?<br /><br />lately i've been able to turn my ability to dissociate into a useful skill to employ when i'd like to observe more about what's going on. it's dissociation with the intent to assess more objectively——very different from the kind of i-can't-remember-anything-from-my-childh<wbr />ood dissociation i'm used to, dissociation as a means of avoiding. it helps with the pain and it helps with the estrogen deficiency-induced sensitivities.<br /><br />i don't have to work my way roundabout to complaining about a feeling by overintellectualizing my relationship to words. this space should be somewhere i can find the words, whatever they are, however simple, however petty, however untrue.<br /><br />like, yeah, it irks me that i go out of my way to try to respond to everyone's shit so they don't feel like i do when no one responds to me (which sometimes seems like everyone——my family, my friends—— everyone is all too happy to do). did i talk too much about that thing? did i not offer anything interesting up? does my opinion not warrant acknowledgment? sometimes i wonder if these moments are my autism becoming apparent to people who are not equipped to deal with it. i know it's not fair to get upset with people because they're not upholding their end of a bargain they don't know exists. do i overestimate my level of effort?<br /><br />as i get older, i'm getting to the "who gives a fuck" so much faster. who gives a fuck? cowboy says, you're gonna get over it someday, you might as well get over it now.<br /><br />&lt;3space,<br />gentle

hello, friend.<br /><br />friend, right now you are mostly an empty space. this is, in most ways, comforting to me; i've always struggled deeply with an audience. who do i become when someone else is around? some mixture of them and myself.<br /><br />my parents now joke that i turned 13 and they never saw me again, because i was always in my room. still to this day i often long for spaces that are <i>just mine</i>. there is no one else to fill them, no one else to shape them. there, i'm allowed to be whatever i want to be. i'm allowed to get lost in a book for hours without distraction. i can live-action roleplay some fictional conversation that i'm thinking about for hours, if i choose. if i want, i can painstakingly learn every move to any beyonc&eacute; video i feel like replaying over and over again. i can weep and tear my hair and laugh at nothing and punch a pillow, go wherever my mood and my mood alone takes me.<br /><br />other people influence so much of how i feel, what i do, how comfortable i am. i've gotten much better at maintaining my own speed, my sense of self. these days, i feel grounded, solid in a way i've never before experienced. it's kinda weird, lol. so much of my identity has been built on flux, on shapeshifting, on disappearing. <br /><br />maybe it's just age, but i can't do that as much anymore. i want to be here, now, rooted, present. a lot falls away when that fundamental quality shifts.<br /><br />thanks for the space.<br />xo gentle
