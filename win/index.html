<p>My week has consisted of scaffolding, online dating, spring cleaning and a Cyberman bust. One night last week part of our roof fell off so we’re having renovations done. The house is covered in scaffolding and it’s serving as a nice visual metaphor of my life at the moment. I spent Monday quite excited tbh, having met a really great girl online, but come the middle of the week she seemed to be totally uninterested in me, yay. So I perked myself up, between eating myself into comas and job hunting, by ordering an 80s Cyberman bust from Forbidden Planet. Frankly, it’s way more gorgeous than any girl will ever be so whatevs.</p>

<p>And today I’ve spring cleaned most of the house, top to bottom, because I’m an adult or something. That crept up on me and now it’s just constantly happening. And I’m blogging again. Legit blogging here on Tumblr, reclaiming it back one letter at a time from those who just reblog endless photos of food and cats dressed up as Olaf from <i>Frozen</i>.</p>

<p>I’ve kind of become disillusioned with Twitter lately, so I’m going to hide out here for a while. As long as I avoid the majority of the rest of Tumblr, I’ll be fine. I like it here.</p>

<p>Living in student flats is often quite shit due to cuntish people making shitloads of noise, and generally being arseholes. The guy in the room above me, especially.</p> 
	
<p>But tonight, as I’m feeling the lowest I’ve felt for a long time, all I can hear is someone playing the guitar and I love it. It’s keeping me sane. I just want to go and hug whoever it is and say thanks.</p>
