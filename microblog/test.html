                    <p>Finals season has made me feel so incredibly stupid. No matter how long or how intensely I study, the exam environment causes me to completely blank out and I make so many mistakes. I don't think I failed any finals (yet) but my GPA is genuinely pathetic. I am at least a tiny bit reassured by the fact that this is just an engineering undergrad canon event.</p>
                    <p>I am excited for winter break. I'm going to spend every waking hour drawing, writing, and coding for this site and my characters. Speaking of, I'm planning to order custom keychains and stickers of my OCs, Dio/Dillon and Lys. I'm going to put them everywhere so when people notice, they'll ask, and I get to start info-dumping about them >:D</p>
