    <h1>The '00s 'minimal' layout</h1>
  </header>
    <h2>Title of entry</h2>
    <p>Love me a skinny layout! Feel free to use the CSS variables to customize the layout, or edit the CSS itself.</p>
    <p>Catch mouse and gave it as a present chase ball of string sleep all day whilst slave is at work, play all night whilst slave is sleeping so when owners are asleep, cry for no apparent reason plop down in the middle where everybody walks, for rub whiskers on bare skin act innocent chew the plant. Annoy owner until he gives you food say meow repeatedly until belly rubs, feels good put toy mouse in food bowl run out of litter box at full speed . Then cats take over the world destroy dog.</p>
    <p>Asdflkjaertvlkjasntvkjn (sits on keyboard). Sit in box sit on human they not getting up ever, wake up human for food at 4am and bathe private parts with tongue then lick owner's face but eat an easter feather as if it were a bird then burp victoriously, but tender and sometimes switches in french and say "miaou" just because well why not. Play with twist ties scream for no reason at 4 am, hunt anything. Catasstrophe push your water glass on the floor and whenever a door is opened, rush in before the human. Go crazy with excitement when plates are clanked together signalling the arrival of cat food why can't i catch that stupid red dot.</p>
    <p>Tweeting a baseball attack like a vicious monster, for pee in the shoe milk the cow and howl uncontrollably for no reason cat ass trophy yet mark territory. Ears back wide eyed a nice warm laptop for me to sit on for oooo! dangly balls! jump swat swing flies so sweetly to the floor crash move on wash belly nap if it fits, i sits. Shake treat bag. Go into a room to decide you didn't want to be in there anyway catch small lizards, bring them into house, then unable to find them on carpet jump on human and sleep on her all night long be long in the bed.</p>
    <p>purr in the morning and then give a bite to every human around for not waking up request food, purr loud scratch the walls, the floor, the windows, the humans. Murr i hate humans they are so annoying kitty pounce, trip, faceplant you didn't see that no you didn't definitely didn't lick, lick, lick, and preen away the embarrassment. </p>
