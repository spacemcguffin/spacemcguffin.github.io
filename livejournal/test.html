<h2 class="subheaders">timelordwannabe</h2> 

<p>Fifteen long years ago today, 17 December 2009, I was messing about with my old school bag, putting Christmas presents into the boot of my car, when I spotted some writing on the inside of my bag. It said, <i>‘You may never realise this but meh, your my best friend + i loves you lotsh :)’</i> – and it was written by Charlie. Bloody hell. Fifteen years. Half my lifetime ago.</p>

<p>I only know that cos I have a tiny handful of diary entries from December 2009. Reading them back is slightly cringeworthy. Another point of note is that I came up with my old username, <i>timelordwannabe</i>, on 21 December 2008. Sixteen years ago. Prior to that, between February and December, I believe my 2008 diary was called <i>‘from the mind and keyboard of lewis’</i> but god knows what my shorter username was.</p>

<h2 class="subheaders">Old tweets</h2> 

<p>About a month ago, I unearthed a bunch of tweets from 2019 and 2020 using the Wayback Machine.</p>

<p><b>2019 tweets</b></p>

<li>wish i could ctrl-z my old livejournal.</li>

<li>i’m so glad the college prospectus video my tutor forced me into is still online, 8 years after the fact. what a joy</li>

<li>happy mental health awareness week. i am perfectly aware that i am mental and unhealthy, thank u</li>

<li>always strange when someone you’ve followed online for years just disappears one day</li>

<li>lewis “what’s my phase again” christian</li>

<li>this decade has been going on for at least 3 years too many now</li>

<li>astute observation from a piece i wish i could find again: <i>in the early internet days, you would log on to ‘pull’ some information, read it, then log off. fast forward to now and the internet constantly ‘pushes’ information and content at you, whether you want it or not.</i></li>

<li>i always get joy out of finding old doctor who clips on youtube in low SD quality and 4:3</li>

<li><i>dj cammy</i> songs on youtube 2k8 takes me back holy shit</li>

<li>a little bit of Christmas died when we stopped circling / listing stuff from the Argos catalogue</li>

<p><b>2020 tweets</b></p>

<li>You know it’s a Chibnall episode when it has characters called Ashad, Yedlarmi, Feekat, Bescot and Fuskle</li>

<li>Just found a music video I made, uploaded by someone else. It now has 20,000+ views. I’ve been robbed.</li>

<li>Upscaling some old grainy photos using an app. Some results venture into waxwork / uncanny valley territory. Some come out really well. Can’t help but think I’m altering the past slightly though.</li>

<li>I’ve started writing a diary again, because I’m stuck in 2003.</li>

<li>Paul McGann was the Doctor in the Time War and regenerated into Christopher Eccleston, and nobody can change my mind.</li>

<li>tempted to go disc-free now I have all of classic <i>who</i> on a hard-drive but I can’t break up with the audio navigation lady just yet, and that opening 1980s disc menu sting is just too good</li>

<li>lying in bed wondering what that girl who fancied me in year 6 is up to now. I hope she’s living her best life</li>

<li>yes I am awake at 2:30am coming up with 1960s <i>doctor who</i> ideas, and your point is?</li>

<li><i>harry potter</i> #1-4 are the best films don’t @ me (#6 is a great book, crap film)</li>

<li>remembering the time I watched goblet of fire at the actual <i>hp</i> studios in London... and I fell asleep during the Voldemort scene. also bumped into lucie jones off <i>the x factor</i> so that was nice</li>

<li>I want to write a <i>Doctor Who</i> reference guide littered with as many inaccuracies, fan myths, incorrect spellings and errors as possible. Working title: <i>The Memory Cheats</i>.</li>

<h2 class="subheaders">Making music</h2> 

<p>Currently listening to <i>Farewell 42</i>, an AI-generated song of mine. I saw someone post an AI-generated song on Twitter the other day and I had to give it a go. Ended up buying a load of credits, so I’ve had a blast generating a few different songs.</p>

<p>You can input a prompt and it’ll make an entirely new song from scratch, complete with vocals, in a genre of your choice. You can also input your own lyrics. I decided to generate a punk rock song about Charlotte’s old school-era band, <i>The Farewell 42s</i>.</p>

<p>Obviously, the AI technology is still quite early (the vocals are very auto-tuney) but it’s quite mind-blowing that I can generate a competent (almost passable) song within literally minutes. The app also allows you to remix, add more to the song, etc. It’s addicting. I’m going through a phase, much like I did last year when I discovered an app for generating AI artwork based on your own prompts. This app also auto-generates a thumbnail image too, based on the lyrics.</p>

<h2 class="subheaders">Nostalgia high</h2> 

<p>I popped <i>The Stolen Earth</i> on earlier as a bit of a palate cleanser and to remind myself that ‘lots of crazy shit happening at once’ can be done well in <i>Doctor Who</i>. I ended up watching the entire two-parter. Really enjoyed it. A proper nostalgia hit, and on the biggest TV I’ve ever seen it on.</p>

<p>God, I miss that era.</p>

<h2 class="subheaders">Lost in smoke</h2> 

<p>Fell down a Twitter rabbit hole, searching my old usernames. Obviously, all my tweets are gone forever, but there are so many replies still floating around and bizarre bits of media attached to them too. Managed to find a couple of old photos of myself – bizarre to think they’re probably just going to languish in the depths of early 2010s Twitter forever, unless those who posted them ever delete their accounts. Also served as a reminder of how long I’ve been on the fucking thing, and how old some of my friends’ accounts are.</p>

<h2 class="subheaders">Half the problem</h2> 

<p>Four papers suddenly announced earlier that Jodie Whittaker is leaving Doctor Who at the end of Series 13. If so, that’s only half of the problem gone. Nothing changes if Chibnall doesn’t go. <i>Le sigh</i>. I need to watch some old <i>Who</i> to remind me of the show I used to love.</p>

<p>Had a nothingy day again. The news is exhausting, all fun is banned, the internet is noisy, and nobody gives a fuck about me. I’ve also eaten too many chocolate biscuits – again.</p>

<h2 class="subheaders">The sequel</h2> 

<p>A brief 2020 summary: there was a global pandemic; I was off work for months during lockdowns; Donald Trump lost the US election; nothing much happened but also everything happened. For Christmas, I got lots of chocolate, sweets, money, vouchers, new pyjamas, jumpers and tops. It was a comfy, low-key day.</p>

<p>I watched the New Year’s London light show. They incorporated drones and lights across various landmarks, and it made a change from the usual firework explosion centred around the London Eye. Had a chill day watching YouTube videos, and nibbles for tea. We’re in Tier 4 now – basically Lockdown III.</p>

<p>Watched the <i>Doctor Who</i> special. Didn’t like it.</p>
