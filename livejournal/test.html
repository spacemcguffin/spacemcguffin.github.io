<h2 class="subheaders">timelordwannabe</h2> 

<p>Fifteen long years ago today, I was putting Christmas presents into the boot of my car, when I spotted some writing on the inside of my school bag. It said, <i>‘You may never realise this but meh, your my best friend + i loves you lotsh :)’</i> – and it was written by Charlie. Bloody hell. Fifteen years. Half my lifetime ago.</p>

<p>I came up with my old username, <i>timelordwannabe</i>, on 21 December 2008.</p>

<h2 class="subheaders">Making music (<i>Farewell 42</i>)</h2> 

<p>Currently listening to <i>Farewell 42</i>, an AI-generated song of mine. I saw someone post an AI-generated song on Twitter the other day and I had to give it a go. Ended up buying a load of credits, so I’ve had a blast generating a few different songs.</p>

<p>You can input a prompt and it’ll make an entirely new song from scratch, complete with vocals, in a genre of your choice. You can also input your own lyrics. I decided to generate a punk rock song about Charlotte’s old school-era band, <i>The Farewell 42s</i>.</p>

<p>Obviously, the AI technology is still quite early (the vocals are very auto-tuney) but it’s quite mind-blowing that I can generate a competent (almost passable) song within literally minutes. The app also allows you to remix, add more to the song, etc. It’s addicting. I’m going through a phase, much like I did last year when I discovered an app for generating AI artwork based on your own prompts. This app also auto-generates a thumbnail image too, based on the lyrics.</p>

<h2 class="subheaders">Ephemera</h2> 

<p>Fell down a Twitter rabbit hole, searching my old usernames. Obviously, all my tweets are gone forever, but there are so many replies still floating around and bizarre bits of media attached to them too. Managed to find a couple of old photos of myself – bizarre to think they’re probably just going to languish in the depths of early 2010s Twitter forever, unless those who posted them ever delete their accounts. Also served as a reminder of how long I’ve been on the fucking thing, and how old some of my friends’ accounts are.</p>
