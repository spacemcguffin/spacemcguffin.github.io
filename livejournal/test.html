<h2 class="subheaders">Making music</h2> 

<p>Currently listening to <i>Farewell 42</i>, an AI-generated song. I saw someone post an AI-generated song on Twitter the other day and I had to give it a go. Ended up buying a load of credits, so I’ve had a blast generating a few different songs.</p>

<p>You can input a prompt and it’ll make an entirely new song from scratch, complete with vocals, in a genre of your choice. You can also input your own lyrics. I decided to generate a punk rock song about Charlotte’s old school-era band, <i>The Farewell 42s</i>.</p>

<p>Obviously, the AI technology is still quite early (the vocals are very auto-tuney) but it’s quite mind-blowing that I can generate a competent (almost passable) song within literally minutes. The app also allows you to remix, add more to the song, etc. It’s addicting. I’m going through a phase, much like I did last year when I discovered an app for generating AI artwork based on your own prompts. This app also auto-generates a thumbnail image too, based on the lyrics.</p>

<h2 class="subheaders">Nostalgia high</h2> 

<p>I popped <i>The Stolen Earth</i> on earlier as a bit of a palate cleanser and to remind myself that ‘lots of crazy shit happening at once’ can be done well in <i>Doctor Who</i>. I ended up watching the entire two-parter. Really enjoyed it. A proper nostalgia hit, and on the biggest TV I’ve ever seen it on.</p>

<p>God, I miss that era.</p>

<h2 class="subheaders">Lost in smoke</h2> 

<p>Fell down a Twitter rabbit hole, searching my old usernames. Obviously, all my tweets are gone forever, but there are so many replies still floating around and bizarre bits of media attached to them too. Managed to find a couple of old photos of myself – bizarre to think they’re probably just going to languish in the depths of early 2010s Twitter forever, unless those who posted them ever delete their accounts. Also served as a reminder of how long I’ve been on the fucking thing, and how old some of my friends’ accounts are.</p>

<h2 class="subheaders">Half the problem</h2> 

<p>Four papers suddenly announced earlier that Jodie Whittaker is leaving Doctor Who at the end of Series 13. If so, that’s only half of the problem gone. Nothing changes if Chibnall doesn’t go. <i>Le sigh</i>. I need to watch some old <i>Who</i> to remind me of the show I used to love.</p>

<p>Had a nothingy day again. The news is exhausting, all fun is banned, the internet is noisy, and nobody gives a fuck about me. I’ve also eaten too many chocolate biscuits – again.</p>

<h2 class="subheaders">The sequel</h2> 

<p>A brief 2020 summary: there was a global pandemic; I was off work for months during lockdowns; Donald Trump lost the US election; nothing much happened but also everything happened. For Christmas, I got lots of chocolate, sweets, money, vouchers, new pyjamas, jumpers and tops. It was a comfy, low-key day.</p>

<p>I watched the New Year’s London light show. They incorporated drones and lights across various landmarks, and it made a change from the usual firework explosion centred around the London Eye. Had a chill day watching YouTube videos, and nibbles for tea. We’re in Tier 4 now – basically Lockdown III.</p>

<p>Watched the <i>Doctor Who</i> special. Didn’t like it.</p>
