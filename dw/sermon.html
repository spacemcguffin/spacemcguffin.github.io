<p>When the residents of <a>South Park</a> face their possible demise, <a>Jesus</a> returns to give them an important message.</p>

<h3 id="plot">Plot</h3>
		
<p>Eric Cartman wakes up in the morning and while brushing his teeth, asks Alexa to play his favorite radio show but only hears static. He complains to his mother that his favorite show isn't working, explaining that he enjoys listening to National Public Radio to hear the "liberals bitch and whine about stuff" and she explains that the show has been cancelled by the government and the new President, to which Cartman expresses disbelief. Cartman arrives at the Bus Stop for school and complains to Kyle and Kenny about the cancellation, calling it the "funniest show ever" where "all the lesbians and Jews complain about stuff" and questions how a President could cancel a show, continuing to complain during the bus ride and discussing various news stories he found amusing. When arriving at South Park Elementary, he expresses further concern that things are changing and that "woke stuff" is suddenly off-limits. When he remarks how "everyone" now rips on the Jews, Kyle does not react, and Cartman expresses concern to Butters that something's wrong with Kyle and that people are giving up.</p>

<p>When Mr. Mackey announces a school assembly, Cartman is hopeful that at least PC Principal has not given up on wokeness. During the assembly, PC Principal complains that not enough people believe in compassion and the world has become corrupt, but prescribes the Bible as a solution, claiming the students need God and declaring himself 'Power-Christian Principal', inviting Jesus Christ to appear before the students, to the disbelief of Cartman, Butters, Stan and Kyle. At Tegridy Farms, Stan is having dinner with his family and mentions Jesus' appearance at school when Randy Marsh expresses concern that Jesus isn't allowed in public schools. That evening, Randy asks an AI assistant on his phone about the situation and it confirms his suspicions that Jesus is not allowed in school and compliments him repeatedly; he remarks that it's good to have someone to talk about stuff with, ignoring his wife Sharon laying in bed next to him.</p>

<p>The next morning at school, Jesus is standing in the hallway around the students when Cartman pulls Butters aside to talk to him about PC Principal's change of heart. Cartman declares that he fears woke is now dead and expresses concern that now anyone can use the word "retarded", hate Jews, or use gay slurs, and further admits that as long as anyone can do these things, he no longer feels he knows what to do himself. At Skeeter's Wine Bar, the adults are gathered as news anchor Tammy Thompson talks about the new President pushing more religion in schools and that he has threatened to sue anyone who disagrees. Randy questions who the President thinks he is, and Gerald Broflovski claims he warned others about this and was ignored. Townspeople remark they voted for him to "get rid of woke stuff", but complain all he does now is sue people and profit off himself. Gerald and Randy lead the townspeople, including the President's former voters, in an angry mob to the Garrison Residence, violently breaking down the door, only to find Garrison, Rick and their dog relaxing on the couch watching White Lotus on television. They accuse him of being the "Middle Eastern tinpot dictator" and "retarded faggot in the White House", but Rick insists Garrison was not re-elected and hasn't been back to Washington, D.C. in years.</p>

<p>At the White House, the new Prime Minister of Canada arrives to see the President, Donald Trump, who is exhibiting the exact mannerisms and behavior as Saddam Hussein and accompanied by his background music. When the Prime Minister tries to discuss the new tariffs on his country, Trump threatens to bomb him like he did Iraq, to which the Prime Minister insists he bombed Iran and Trump questions the difference. Visiting a hallway of portraits of himself, he complains that a painter has drawn his penis too small, and has the painter removed and threatens to sue him. Trump then returns to his bedroom, strips naked, and gets in bed with Satan, complaining that he has been working hard all day, to which Satan dismissively claims he is just "posting stupid memes and fucking around" and complains that Trump's penis so small he cannot see it.</p>

<p>In the morning, Cartman leaves his home in a 'Woke is Dead' T-shirt and heads through town and across the Playground, seeing 'Men Only' and 'Women Only' restrooms, and then heads over to Stark's Pond, sitting at the bench as some ducks fly away and looking forlorn, when Butters appears to comfort him. Cartman observes he's not special anymore and can't laugh and have fun now, and declares he's going to kill himself, and Butters, in an involuntary suicide pact. Butters tries to promise him woke is still out there, waiting to come back, and that Cartman has to give it some time to shine again. Cartman agrees to wait until Tuesday, at which point he will kill them both. At school, Stan is called to PC Principal's office, where PC Principal accuses him of not being comfortable with Jesus being in school and bullying him. Stan defends himself that he would not allow Jesus to sit at his lunch table with him and Craig Tucker because it was full, and questions why PC Principal has changed so much since November. PC Principal explains that he realized his side was hopeless and found Christ, and threatens to expel Stan if he refuses to accept Jesus. Stan tries to insist that it is illegal to expel him for this, but PC Principal insists "not much" is illegal anymore and forces Stan to pledge acceptance of Christ into his heart, his school and cafeteria table.</p>

<p>At the White House, Trump is shown partying on the White House lawn with a number of his supporters, but when he arrives inside, he is told by White House secretary Karoline Leavitt that he has a call from angry former supporters, receiving a call from the townspeople lead by Randy, who complains about Stan being forced to sit with Jesus. Trump insists he "take a rest" because the protesting makes him look bad, and when Randy protests, Trump threatens to sue the town of South Park for five billion dollars, then returns to bed naked with Satan again, who complains he isn't in the mood and that someone on his Instagram has commented about Trump being on the Epstein list, pointing out whenever it comes up Trump insists people relax. Trump denies this and tells him to relax. Satan then complains that Trump reminds him of this other guy he used to date, claiming they are "exactly alike", and Trump promises he loves him in a similar manner.</p>

<p>On Tuesday at the Stotch Residence, Butters is playing with trucks in his bedroom when Linda Stotch lets him know that Cartman has arrived and mentioned they had plans together. Butters asks her to tell Cartman he isn't home but Linda suggests instead of being antisocial he go out and play with Cartman, who is in the garage playing in the Stotch family car with a hose, to Butters' horror. Butters tries to stop Cartman from committing suicide by carbon monoxide poisoning in the car, but when Butters tries to talk to him, Cartman convinces him in a hurry to shut the car door to avoid letting the fumes out, and Cartman questions if he wants to die a slow death and Butters agrees, and they take turns sucking a hose together to inhale and poison themselves with carbon monoxide.</p>

<p>The news magazine 60 Minutes covers the South Park townspeople's protest of the President, while quickly and nervously affirming that the President is a "great man" and insisting they don't agree with the protest, going live to an anxious, fearful anchor in town who reports on the protest, pretending to not know why Stan and Randy are questioning the President's policies, declaring that Stan is "probably a faggot". Randy protests he doesn't like being told what to do, Darryl Weathers protests that while he felt woke stuff went too far, the answer isn't going "too far the other way", and Stephen Stotch states it's good to be compassionate and his family is proud to own an electric car. Back at the Stotch Residence, Butters and Cartman are in the car, continuing to try to poison themselves but remarking it is taking a very long time. At the school, PC Principal hangs his head in silence during news coverage of more townspeople arriving for the protest lead by Randy, declaring the fight is not hopeless and they are in for the long haul.</p>

<p>Jesus then appears to the townspeople, handing out bread and inviting them to break with him, declaring that it is his body given for him, while whispering through gritted teeth that he didn't want to come back to the school but it was "part of a lawsuit and the agreement with Paramount", and he warns the townspeople that now that people are backing down to the President, the town is at risk of cancellation similarly to The Late Show with Stephen Colbert and he urges the people of South Park to shut up repeatedly, pointing out that if "someone has the power of the presidency and also has the power to sue and take bribes, then he can do anything to anyone". The townspeople gather at the Law Offices of Taylor, Broflovski & Swift as Gerald negotiates the lawsuit with the President, settled at $3.5 million dollars, requiring funding cuts to the schools, hospitals and roads, and for the townspeople to do "pro-Trump messaging". The town is initially unsure but Gerald convinces them to work together. The town's pro-Trump ad is then shown, in which a live-action synthetically-generated Donald Trump is showing walking through a desert to make an unspecified sacrifice for the United States, stripping in the nude and struggling to survive the desert based on his love for the country. His small penis speaks to say he endorses the message, while a narrator declares that while his penis is "teeny tiny", his love for the American people is large.</p>

<p>Butters and Cartman are still sitting in the car, waiting for the carbon monoxide to finally take effect, as the credits begin to roll.</p>
