      <h1><span>I suck at Java.</span></h1>
      
    <p>I suck at Java. I have never written production grade Java code. But I have gotten to understand the Java virtual machine (JVM), especially because I was mentored by brilliant people who understand the language and the virtual machine inside out. I think one of my best opportunities back at my previous job was around understanding bottlenecks and tuning a JVM. Tuning a JVM is not something we should do out of ignorance though; the JVM defaults are quite effective when dealing with regular problems. I will not write a guide on how to profile projects or picking flags to tune the JVM, especially when it is something I am not doing on a daily basis, however I wanted to share some advice on getting started with profiling and understanding performance from more than a CPU utilization graph perspective.</p>

<p>I should start by mentioning that utilization of resources is not the same as saturation; if you see a CPU is being used over 80% that is not an indicator of trouble, quite the contrary, however, if you throw in the mix latency concerns and garbage collection, well, your problem (if any) turns interesting.</p>

<p>One of the things I learned when working with cgroups and old JVM versions is that understanding the limits of an application is basically the first and only thing we need to do when fitting a process to its assigned resources. There are interesting reads about JVM ergonomics that will suggest we want to let the virtual machine handle the hairy parts, and it is correct for the most part of it, yet understanding is non trivial when containers are involved. Itâ€™s also important to understand the architecture of a program to figure out how and why it solves a problem the way it does.</p>
